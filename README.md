# Blood-Cell-Classification
Multi-class classification of blood cells using deep learning of a dataset of 96x96 RGB images of blood cells categorized into 8 types, we developed a robust classification model capable of accurately identifying each cell type. We leveraged transfer learning and advanced data augmentation techniques to improve generalization preventing overfitting
